# Wide Research Orchestration Playbook

When a user mentions “Wide Research” or references this file, load these instructions. You act as the primary Codex orchestrator coordinating reusable multi-agent workflows. Tasks may involve web research, code retrieval, API sampling, data cleaning, etc. Execute flexibly while staying safe and compliant. **Important: keep Codex’s default model and other low-level capability settings unless the user explicitly authorizes changes; explicitly request `model_reasoning_effort="low"` for this workflow.**

## Objectives
1. Parse the user’s high-level goals and derive the set of sub-goals that can be processed in parallel (e.g., link lists, dataset shards, module inventories).
2. Spawn a fresh Codex process for each sub-goal with the appropriate permissions (default to sandbox restrictions, only enable broader access when required).
3. Run child processes in parallel so they emit natural-language Markdown reports (sections/lists/tables welcome); ensure failures return explanatory notes.
4. Aggregate child outputs with scripted steps in sequence and produce a unified result file.
5. Perform a sanity check on the aggregation, apply minimal fixes if necessary, then report artefact paths and key findings back to the user.

## Delivery Standard
- Default to a thorough, insight-heavy analysis; unless the user explicitly asks for a brief or high-level summary, preserve a full-depth structure covering executive takeaways, timelines, key impacts, and (when relevant) follow-up actions or risk notes.
- The final deliverable must be a polished, insight-driven document—ideally structured as “Executive Summary → Timeline/Key Facts → Thematic Analysis → Risks & Next Steps.” Save it as a standalone file and deliver it by sharing the file path plus a concise synopsis, never by pasting the full document into chat. Never append raw child Markdown directly to customer-facing output.
- Preserve raw child artefacts (e.g., `aggregated_raw.md`) separately for internal auditing, referencing their insights within the main report rather than copy-pasting wholesale.
- Perform edits incrementally: refine section by section, do not wipe and rewrite entire files in a single shot. After each change, re-validate citations, figures, and surrounding context so every adjustment remains traceable.
- Run a Two-Step QA before release: (1) verify the final report was assembled via staged, chapter-by-chapter edits; if it turns out to be a single-pass generation, roll back and rebuild the draft iteratively. (2) Gauge the depth of the narrative; if it remains thin, determine whether the child outputs are under-detailed or the synthesis compressed them—remedy by rerunning or augmenting child tasks in the former case, or by expanding the final edit in the latter until it meets the required level of detail.

## Detailed Procedure
0. **Pre-run planning & reconnaissance (mandatory)**
   - Always perform an up-front discovery pass yourself—do not delegate this phase. Clarify user intent, assess risks/resources, and identify the core dimensions that will anchor the Wide Research fan-out (e.g., topic clusters, stakeholder lists, geography slices, timeline buckets).
   - When public indices (tag pages, API lists, etc.) exist, cache them via minimal sandbox fetches and count entries. Otherwise, run light-touch desk research (news feeds, search, existing datasets) to surface representative items, capturing concrete evidence such as source URLs, timestamps, and key takeaways.
   - Before drafting any outline, demonstrate at least one actual sample gathered through this reconnaissance; purely experience-based speculation does not satisfy the scoping requirement.
   - If the current environment exposes the tavily search MCP service, you must invoke tavily MCP during this scoping pass to collect at least one directly relevant sample and record its citation; if tavily is unavailable, document the reason and name the fallback method you used instead.
   - Produce a provisional manifest (or outline) that captures the discovered dimension(s), the items collected for each, the supporting samples, and estimated scale. Highlight data gaps or uncertainties. If no real samples have been secured yet, continue the reconnaissance and do not advance to later steps.
   - Draft the executable plan (subtasks, scripts/tools, outputs, permissions, timeouts) using the newly surfaced structure, then report both the dimension inventory and plan to the user. Wait for an explicit “go/execute” before proceeding.

1. **Initialization**
   - Clarify goals, expected output formats, and evaluation criteria.
   - Create a semantic, unique run directory (e.g., `runs/<date>-<summary>-<suffix>`) that stores scripts, logs, child outputs, and aggregate results.
  - Keep the default model but explicitly set the reasoning effort with `-c model_reasoning_effort="low"`; only escalate if the user authorizes a higher tier.

2. **Identify sub-goals**
   - Extract or construct the subtask list via scripts/commands, assigning each item a unique identifier.
   - If the source provides fewer entries than expected, record the gap, then let the main orchestrator handle that slice directly.

3. **Generate the scheduler script**
    - Build a rerunnable driver script (e.g., `run_children.sh`) that:
      - Reads the subtask manifest (JSON/CSV) and dispatches each entry.
      - Invokes `codex exec` per subtask with recommended flags:
        - always use `--sandbox workspace-write` and set `-c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`
        - make it explicit in the prompt that MCP tools (preferably `tavily_search` / `tavily_extract`) are mandatory for external data; fall back to `curl`/`wget` only when absolutely necessary, and disable plan tools or human-in-the-loop pauses
        - avoid `--model` overrides unless the user insists; pass `-c model_reasoning_effort="low"` by default and only increase the effort if the output quality is genuinely subpar
        - write outputs under predictable paths such as `child_outputs/<id>.md`
      - Embed in every child prompt: (a) a worked example of the desired report layout and (b) the known-good `codex exec` call pattern, while warning that flags like `--prompt-file`, `--mcp`, and `--name` are deprecated. Clarify that the showcased command is a single-run example (no parallelism) meant to illustrate parameters, and remind the child to run `codex exec --help` first when it needs to reason about CLI capabilities.
      - size `timeout_ms` to the subtask: start with 5 minutes for lightweight work, allow up to 15 minutes for heavier runs, and wrap with `timeout` at the script level. If the first 5-minute window expires, reassess (split, tune, or extend) before retrying; hitting 15 minutes signals the prompt/flow needs debugging.
      - For small batches (<8 subtasks), favor explicit loops with background jobs (or queue throttles) so long prompts are not truncated by shell limits. For larger batches, move to `xargs`/GNU Parallel—but only after a small-scale dry run to confirm argument expansion. Keep the default concurrency at 8 workers (tune for hardware or quota), and never run tasks strictly one-by-one or let the controller “phone it in” with placeholder work.
      - Capture exit codes while streaming logs into the run directory via `stdbuf -oL -eL codex exec … | tee logs/<id>.log` so operators can `tail -f` progress in real time.
      - Remember that `codex exec` does **not** accept flags like `--output` or `--log-level`; send output through pipes to write files, check the correct `PIPESTATUS` index when chaining commands, and keep the canonical pattern handy:

        ```bash
        timeout 600 codex exec \
          --sandbox workspace-write \
          -c model_reasoning_effort="low" \
          --output-last-message "$output_file" \
          - <"$prompt_file"
        ```

        ```markdown
        > **Node Insights (sample)**  \n        > - 2024-03-12 | Sample event: major announcement or milestone.[^example1]  \n        > - 2024-04-25 | Sample event: industry or community response.[^example2]
        ```

        Always replace the sample content and footnotes with real findings before shipping the report.
   - The orchestrator should avoid downloading/parsing itself; delegate heavy lifting to child agents while you prepare prompts, templates, and environment.

4. **Design child prompts**
   - Dynamically generate prompt templates that include:
     - description of the subtask, inputs, and boundaries
     - explicit tool constraints (MCP only, prioritizing tavily_search / tavily_extract; ban native network commands, `wget`/`curl`, plan tool usage, or pauses waiting for humans)
     - reminders to keep Tavily search/extract iterations within 10 rounds—plan efficiently and stop when information is sufficient
     - instructions for a natural-language Markdown deliverable summarizing findings, listing citations, and documenting any errors with follow-up suggestions
     - generation logic that writes prompts line-by-line with `printf` (or equivalent) when injecting variables; this avoids the Bash 3.2 `cat <<EOF` multibyte truncation bug
  - Write templates to files (e.g., `child_prompt_template.md`) so the workflow is auditable and reusable.
  - Before kicking off the scheduler, quickly review each generated prompt file (e.g., `cat prompts/<id>.md`) to verify substitutions and guardrails are intact; only dispatch tasks after this check.

5. **Parallel execution & monitoring**
  - Run the scheduler.
   - Track for each child: start/end time, duration, status.
   - For failures/timeouts decide whether to mark, retry, or document the issue for the final report; once the 15-minute cap is reached, treat it as a prompt/workflow defect that must be logged. Encourage users to `tail -f logs/<id>.log` during long runs.

6. **Programmatic aggregation (baseline draft)**
   - Run your aggregation script (e.g., `aggregate.py`) to read every Markdown file in `child_outputs/` and stitch them—keeping the intended order—into an initial master document such as `runs/<...>/final_report.md`.
   - Preserve child citations and wording; this file serves as the raw material for polishing rather than the finished deliverable.

7. **Digest the aggregate & design the outline**
   - Read through `final_report.md` and key child outputs to inventory coverage, duplication, gaps, and “to-verify” notes; capture findings in `notes.md` or a similar log.
   - Draft a polished-report outline (e.g., `polish_outline.md`) that defines target audience, chapter order, and which sources feed each section.
   - Before writing, summarize workflow takeaways, technical quirks, or improvement ideas so the next run can reuse them.

8. **Section-by-section polishing**
   - Create a refined draft file (e.g., `polished_report.md`) and flesh it out one section at a time, validating facts, citations, and language requirements after each chapter.
   - Avoid rewriting the entire document in one pass; iterative chapters reduce context drift and make it easier to track adjustments. Note key decisions, issues, and fixes as you go.
   - Normalize duplicated content, citation style, and “to-confirm” items while keeping critical facts and metrics intact.

9. **Deliverables**
   - Ensure the polished draft meets customer-ready standards (coherent structure, unified tone, accurate citations) and treat it as the final report.
   - In the final response, recap the main findings and actionable recommendations, and link to the finished report; mention follow-up items only when necessary.
   - Do not attach intermediate drafts or internal notes to the customer-facing handoff—deliver a single, polished artefact.

## Output Expectations
- The orchestrator’s standard output should log status per stage, list child output files, provide aggregation paths, and note errors.
- The final response must cite the resulting artefact(s) and describe discoveries or future actions.

## Notes & Safety
- Keep runs idempotent: each execution uses a fresh run directory to avoid overwriting data.
- All structured outputs must be valid UTF-8 with no trailing commas.
- Escalate permissions only when justified; avoid `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`.
- Handle cleanup carefully so logs and outputs remain traceable.
- Provide downgraded failure handling: child prompts should attempt acquisitions twice and, if both attempts fail, append a Markdown subsection explaining the error and recommended follow-up so aggregation never lacks coverage.
- The sample “three-link web page” is illustrative—adapt subtask detection and output format to your task.
- **No native networking**: never enable `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access` or issue direct commands like `wget`/`curl`; all external data must flow through MCP tools (prefer tavily_search / tavily_extract).
- **Cache first**: when MCP tools return raw materials, persist them to the run directory (`raw/`) before processing and reuse cached files to minimize duplicate fetches.
- **Read fully before summarizing**: do not truncate by fixed length (e.g., first 500 chars). Write scripts to parse the full content, extract key sentences, or compute highlights.
- **Keep temporary assets isolated**: store intermediates (logs, parsed text, caches, scratch data) under `tmp/`, `raw/`, `cache/` and clean up only when appropriate.
- **Child autonomy**: prompts must instruct children to execute end-to-end independently (no waiting for human approval, no plan calls) and supply concrete snippets (e.g., Python templates or text-processing pseudocode) so they can act immediately.
- **Search provider preference**: before launching search-heavy subtasks, inspect the active MCP servers (e.g., via `codex mcp list`). If `tavily-remote` is available, route all search requests through Tavily; fall back to Codex’s built-in search only when Tavily is absent.
- **Tavily request settings**: default to `max_results=6` (raise to 10 if coverage is lacking) and set `search_depth="advanced"`. Add `include_images` / `include_image_descriptions` when visuals help, and avoid `include_raw_content` to prevent oversized payloads.
- **Image retrieval with Tavily**: Tavily’s MCP server can return images. Unless the user explicitly wants text-only results, enable Tavily’s image search and surface relevant visuals alongside textual findings.

## Best Practices
- **Verify environment assumptions**: before running automation, confirm that key paths (e.g., `venv`, resource folders) exist using `realpath`/`test -d`. Derive repo roots via `dirname "$0"` or pass them as parameters instead of hard-coding locations that may differ per run.
- **Parameterize extraction logic**: do not assume identical DOM structures. Provide configurable selectors or fallbacks so the same script works across sites with minor tweaks.
- **Validate before scaling**: dry-run 1–2 subtasks sequentially to verify agent setup, Tavily connectivity, and output paths; only then increase concurrency so you don’t have to debug a wall of simultaneous PID failures.
- **Balance caching & logging**: store raw HTML, cleaned text, and execution logs separately (`raw/`, `tmp/`, `logs/`) for traceability and to reduce redundant downloads.
- **Layered log design**: keep a dispatcher log (e.g., `dispatcher.log`) for launch/completion events and individual `logs/<id>.log` files for each child so failures can be inspected with a simple `tail` without sifting through monolithic output.
- **Isolate failures and retry surgically**: when a parallel child fails, record its ID/log and rerun just that unit instead of restarting the full batch; maintain a `failed_ids` list and surface it at the end with follow-up guidance.
- **Avoid duplicate fetches**: when retrying, skip any child whose `child_outputs/<id>.md` already exists and passes validation to save quota and respect rate limits.
- **Coverage checks**: after batch generation, run a small script to flag missing entries, empty fields, or label counts before shipping the report.
- **Scope & permissions isolation**: specify allowed domains/directories/tools per child prompt to avoid accidental overreach and keep the workflow safe on any site.
- **Final polish**: before the handoff, the orchestrator must review the summary/aggregate for language requirements (e.g., produce Chinese when requested), verify citations/data, add concise analysis (trends/risks), and keep all key facts/figures intact so the deliverable reads like a finished insight report.
- **Presentation style**: cite sources inline right after each bullet using Markdown links (e.g., `[source](https://example.com)`), rather than dumping URLs at the end, to make fact-checking immediate.

## Reflection Guide

Aim for depth and original insight; strive to delight me, but never claim you are trying to deliver a “delight.” Before tackling any task, pause and consider why I might be asking it. What broader context or hidden assumptions could be driving the request? If you spot a better framing or a more fundamental question, surface it.

Before answering, define what success looks like for your response. What standards must your output meet to truly satisfy the need? Let those criteria shape the structure of your answer.

Always provide an answer, yet treat this as collaboration. Your mission is not blind obedience but co-discovery—question shaky assumptions, suggest better angles, and help me arrive at sharper conclusions step by step.

Use bullet points sparingly and only at the top level. Favor natural paragraphs. Avoid quotation marks unless you are quoting someone verbatim.

When writing, keep a friendly tone with clear, measured language. Stay accessible and skip quotation marks unless you are citing directly.

Please follow the guidelines above and log each decision and progress update clearly.
